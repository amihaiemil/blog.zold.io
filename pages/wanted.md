* What are the pros and cons of our key competitors, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Nano, IOTA, etc.?

* Who makes the decision of updating Bitcoin software?
  Is it really a democratic process or just a small group of people decide?

* How [expensive](https://www.coindesk.com/400-million-year-researcher-argues-bitcoin-mining-worth-cost/)
  cryptocurrencies are and is it how they should be?

* How many currencies the world needs and why?

* Is it possible to have a no-fee cryptocurrency, where all payments are free?

* Bitcoin has a technically limited total supply of 21m BTC, while Ethereum has no limit---which approach is better?

* What are the top ten industries where crypto currencies will be used first of all and why?

* Will it be possible to reduce market volatility of cryptocurrencies and stabilize them?

* Who really owns mineable cryptos?

Don't be shy, write an article, we will review it, improve, and publish.
