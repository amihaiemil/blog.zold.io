## 2018

29 Jan<br/>
The idea was born.
It became obvious that having our own cryptocurrency would be benefitial for [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com).

12 May<br/>
Version [0.1](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/tree/0.1) has been
[released](https://rubygems.org/gems/zold/versions/0.1) to RubyGems.

20 May<br/>
The first version of the [White Paper](https://papers.zold.io/wp.pdf) has been published.

28 May<br/>
The first transaction has been sent.

16 Jun<br/>
We started to recruit Ruby developers on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/194602/brave-ruby-developer-for-a-new-cryptocurrency-zerocracy),
to build a team.

2 Jul<br/>
The first version of the
[Green Paper](https://papers.zold.io/green-paper.pdf) has been published.

8 Jul<br/>
This [blog](https://github.com/zold-io/blog.zold.io)
has been started and the first article has been published.

14 Jul<br/>
[#402](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/issues/402):
Critical bugs with nodes connectivity were fixed,
the network is stable (over 70 nodes).

22 Jul<br/>
[#399](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/issues/399):
PUSH, PULL, and UPDATE are multi-threaded now, which makes
them much faster than before.

<br/>

The future (the order is not exact):

  * Make sure both PUSH and PULL are fast enough (less than 4s)
  * Launch Telegram bot
  * Stabilize hosting bonuses distribution (they fail often)
  * Migrate "scoring farm" from Ruby to C/C++
  * Release [Java client API](https://github.com/zold-io/java-api)
  * Make node software fully multi-threaded
