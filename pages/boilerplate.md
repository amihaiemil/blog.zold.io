<span class="par">Short description</span>
Zold is an experimental cryptocurrency for fast micro-payments without Blockchain.

<span class="par">Longer description</span>
Zold is a faster and more efficient cryptocurrency alternative to Blockchain-based
digital payment systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Zold is based on its
own custom consensus protocol called Zit, which doesn't have a central
ledger and processes transactions between wallets simultaneously. Zold
has a potential to process a million transactions per second keeping
confirmation time as low as one hour.

<span class="par">Full description</span>
In the last few years digital currencies have successfully demonstrated
their ability to become an alternative financial instrument in
many different markets. Most of the technologies available at the moment
are based on the principles of Blockchain architecture, including
dominating currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite its popularity,
Blockchain is not the best possible solution for all scenarios.
One such example is for fast micro-payments. Zold is an experimental
alternative that enables distributed transactions between anonymous
users, making micro-payments financially feasible and fast. It borrows
the “proof of work” principle from Bitcoin, and suggests a different
architecture for digital wallet maintenance.
