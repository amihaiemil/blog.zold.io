The first version of [Zold](https://github.com/zold-io/zold) is implemented
in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
a semi-object-oriented programming language. It was my personal
decision to choose Ruby, even though I'm pretty fluent in Java, JavaScript,
C++, and PHP. "Why Ruby?" is the question I've been hearing since the first day of our [Telegram group](https://t.me/zold_io).
Here is the summary of my reasoning.

<!--more-->

First, Ruby software is very easy to deploy. Zold is distributed
as Ruby "gem" hosted at [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/zold).
In order [to install](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
a new version of it, together with all
dependencies, you just need to run, from the
command line (either Unix, OSX, or Windows):

{% highlight text %}
$ gem install zold
{% endhighlight %}

Java, for example, doesn't have (to my knowledge) a package manager
with the same functionality.

Second, Ruby is a very compact language. It is much weaker, comparing to
Java and C++, in terms of its object-orientation, but if used right,
its code could be clean and at the same time very concise. In Java, I believe,
the source code we have now would take 3-4 times more lines.

Moreover, thanks to its brevity, Ruby is a perfect language for experimenting. Zold,
which you can see in its
[Git history](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/commits/master),
was not created in one step. We had a number of initial releases, which
didn't really work. It was necessary to experiment and re-write. Ruby is a perfect
tool for that, since it takes less time to say in Ruby
what I want to say, comparing to Java or C++.

Third, Ruby is perfectly covered by [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop),
its de-facto static analyzer, which we use to its full capacity. All rules
from the analyzer are enabled and only a very small subset of them are
[slightly suppressed](https://github.com/zold-io/zold/blob/0.14.16/.rubocop.yml).

There are a number of drawbacks of Ruby, of course. First of all, it is [slow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2529852/why-do-people-say-that-ruby-is-slow).
Well, it is definitely slower than Java and, of course, C++. Second,
it's [single-CPU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26579532/ruby-how-to-thread-across-cores-processors)
even though it's multi-threaded. In other words, we can't
use all CPUs as easily as we do that in Java. Third, it's not object-oriented
enough to guarantee disciplined development for a long term.

I believe that in some time, when Zold protocol is stabilized, the network
of nodes is large enough, and the software community around Zold grows big, we will be
able to create parallel implementations of Zold software, in other languages.
