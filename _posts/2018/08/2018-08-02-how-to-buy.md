Zold is a cryptocurrency with a [mission]({% post_url 2018/07/2018-07-08-mission %}).
It doesn't have Airdrop or Bounty programs.
We created it as a catalyst for the revolution of software development industry, [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) is leading.
There are only three possible ways to get ZLD.

<!--more-->

First, you can fund any project managed by [Zerocrat](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html) and get
an equal amount of ZLD. Say, you donate $512 to one of
[these projects](https://www.0crat.com/board) and immediately
get 512 ZLD to your [web wallet](https://wts.zold.io). We will identify
you by your GitHub user name.

You can even donate to Zold Ruby core project itself, just click this
button and pay via Stripe:

</a>

Second, you can [join](https://www.0crat.com/join) one of the projects
managed by Zerocrat as a programmer and receive ZLD for the tasks completed.
At the moment we give away ZLD as a bonus on top of every dollar you make
in Zerocracy. If you are a [good](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/07/24/bugs-or-pull-requests.html)
and disciplined programmer, you will make
<del>a few</del> 2-3 thousand dollars (and ZLD) every months, working part-time.

Third, you can host your own Zold node and collect taxes and hosting bonuses.
[This page](https://github.com/zold-io/zold) explains how to do that. If your
node is powerful enough (more than 4 CPUs), you will earn 2-6 ZLD every day.
