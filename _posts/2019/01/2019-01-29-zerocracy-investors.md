In the previous [blog post]({% post_url 2019/01/2019-01-16-make-me-rich %})
I explained how you can get rich via
Zold investments. That was our plan for short-term investors, who are basically
willing to lend us money and get away with a decent profit in a few months.
There is yet another possibility to help us and become rich together
with us---by making long-term strategic investments into shares
of stock of Zerocracy.

More official information is [here](https://papers.zold.io/fin-model.pdf),
by the way. This blog post just paints
the future, rather informally.

First, you give us your money. Let's say, $200,000 (we don't accept anything
smaller than $100,000 at the moment). You can either wire them to our
account in Wells Fargo or send in BTC/ETH to our crypto wallet.

Once we receive the money, you get a signed [SAFE](https://www.seedramp.com/safe.html)
document from us. We got the template from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/),
a startup incubator that invested into AirBnb, Dropbox, and others. The "cap"
in the document will be set to $16,000,000 (at the time of writing this blog post).

This will mean exactly this (here is a [large blog post](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html)
from me, explaining how SAFE works): once the company is sold or gets listed
in any exchange (IPO), you will get 1.25% of its equity. Until that monent, you
just have this SAFE paper in your hands and nothing else. You will not
get any dividends from us, you will not share any profit, you will not
make any decisions in the company. You just hold a promise from us that you
will receive 1.25% once the company gets out of our control.

We predict this happens (I mean the IPO, since we are not going to sell, ever) in 2024
and our market cap at that time will be somewhere around $4 billion. Thus,
your return will be $50 million, which is 250x in five years. Not bad, right?
How exactly you will get that cash? You will simply sell you shares of stocks in any
exchange or you will be able to hold them even further, hoping that the
price will go up after the IPO (which often happens).

What if this won't happen? What if there will be no IPO in the next five years?

In that case, there is a plan B for you. We promise to buy you back
with 2x in two years after your investment, if you don't feel comfortable of holding
longer. We will pay you as many ZLD as your initial investment was equal to,
at the moment of investment. For example, right now your $200,000 equals to
224,719 ZLD (the rate is around $0.89 per zold). Thus, we promise to buy
you out for 449,438 ZLD in a year, if you will feel like it. You will have
to make that decision in exactly two years after the investment.

When you are ready, just [email us](mailto:investor@zerocracy.com).
